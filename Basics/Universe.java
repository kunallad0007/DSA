/* 
This is a simple Java program that prints a greeting message to the console.
It serves as an introduction to Java programming and demonstrates the basic structure of a Java application.
It includes the main method, which is the entry point of the program.
The program prints three lines of text to the console using the System.out.println() method.
The first line prints "Hello Universe!", the second line prints "This is a simple Java program.", and the third line prints "Let's explore the universe of programming together!".
The program is contained within a class named "Universe", which is defined using the "public class" keyword.
The class name must match the filename, so this file should be named "Universe.java".
The program can be compiled and run using a Java compiler and runtime environment.
The output of the program will be displayed in the console or terminal window where it is executed.
The program is a simple example of how to write and run a Java program, and it can be used as a starting point for learning more about Java programming concepts and techniques.

Now, let's explore the code and understand its components:

1. **Package Declaration**: The program is part of the `Basics` package, which is a way to organize related classes in Java.
    Packages help avoid naming conflicts and can be used to group classes with similar functionality.

2. **Class Declaration**: The `Universe` class is declared as `public`, which means it can be accessed from other classes. The class contains the main method, which is the entry point of the program.
    In Java, every application must have at least one class with a `main` method to run.
    The class name must match the filename, so this file should be named `Universe.java`.
3. **Main Method**: The `main` method is defined with the signature `public static void main(String[] args)`. This method is where the program starts executing. The `String[] args` parameter allows the program to accept command-line arguments, although they are not used in this example.

        - `public`: The method can be called from outside the class.
        - `static`: The method belongs to the class, not to instances of the class. This means it can be called without creating an object of the class.
        - `void`: The method does not return any value.
        - `String[] args`: An array of strings that can hold command-line arguments passed to the program.

4. **Print Statements**: The program uses `System.out.println()` to print messages to the console. Each call to this method outputs a string followed by a newline character, which moves the cursor to the next line.
    - The first line prints "Hello Universe!"
    - The second line prints "This is a simple Java program."
    - The third line prints "Let's explore the universe of programming together!"

    The `System.out` object represents the standard output stream, and `println()` is a method that prints the specified string followed by a newline.

5. **Comments**: The program includes comments that explain its purpose and functionality. Comments are ignored by the compiler and are used to provide additional information to anyone reading the code.
    - Single-line comments start with `//` and continue to the end of the line.
    - Multi-line comments are enclosed between `/*` and `*/ /*`, allowing for longer explanations or documentation.


6. **Compilation and Execution**: To run this program, you would typically save it in a file named `Universe.java`, compile it using the Java compiler (`javac Universe.java`), and then run it using the Java runtime (`java Universe`). The output will be displayed in the console.

    - The Java compiler translates the source code into bytecode, which is platform-independent and can be executed on any machine with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
    - The JVM interprets the bytecode and executes it, allowing the program to run on different operating systems without modification.

7. This program is a simple introduction to Java programming and can be used as a starting point for learning more about the language and its features.
    As you progress, you can explore more advanced topics such as object-oriented programming, data structures, algorithms, and Java libraries.
    You can also experiment with modifying the program, adding new features, or creating your own Java applications.
    Happy coding!
